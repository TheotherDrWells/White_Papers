# Whitepapers

This repository contains works-in-progress, concept drafts, and incubated ideas related to trust, alignment, and structural diagnostics in AI systems.

While some whitepapers have matured into their own standalone repositories (see below), this repo serves as the central hub for developing and organizing new and evolving papers.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Archive early drafts and outlines of conceptual whitepapers.
- Track the evolution of core alignment and diagnostic frameworks.
- Provide a single access point for reference, citation, or collaboration.

## Structure

Each whitepaper is stored as either:

- A `.pdf` or `.docx` document in this repo (for early-stage drafts), or
- A link to a standalone GitHub repository (for mature or active projects).
